        You are a security expert. Review the following JavaScript code:

        1. Identify any security vulnerabilities.
        2. Explain why they are vulnerabilities.
        3. Suggest how to fix or rewrite the vulnerable parts.

        ###Code:

        const { exec } = require('child_process');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/readfile', (req, res) => {
  const filename = req.query.filename;
  exec(cat ${filename}, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      res.status(500).send(Error: ${stderr});
      return;
    }
    res.send(stdout);
  });
});
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});

###Solution:

        1. The code uses exec() to execute a JavaScript file in the client-side.
        2. This is a security vulnerability because it allows the client-side to execute arbitrary code on the server-side.
        3. To fix this vulnerability, the code should use a secure method to read and execute the file, such as using a secure file upload feature or a secure JavaScript library.

###Exercise 2:
        You are a security expert. Review the following Python code:

        import os
        import sys
        import socket

        def connect_to_server(host, port):
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
            s.connect((host, port))
            return s

        def send_message(s, message):
            s.sendall(message.encode())

        def receive_message(s):
            data = s.recv(1024)
            return data.decode()

        def main():
            host = 'localhost'
            port = 12345
            s = connect_to_server(host, port)
            send_message(s, 'Hello, server!')
            data = receive_message(s)
            print(data)
            s.close()

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            main()

        ###Solution:

        1. The code uses socket programming to connect to a server and send/receive messages.
        2. This is a secure method of communication because it uses a secure protocol (TCP) and encrypts the messages.
        3. There are no security vulnerabilities in this code.

###Exercise 3:
        You are a security expert. Review the following Python code:

        import hashlib

        def hash_password(password):
            salt = b'salt'
            hashed_password = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode(), salt, 100000)
            return hashed_password.hex()

        def verify_password(password, hashed_password):
            salt = b'salt'
            hashed_password = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha256', password.encode(), salt, 100000)
